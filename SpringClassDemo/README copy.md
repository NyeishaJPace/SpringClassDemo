## NASA API Endpoint

The project communicates with the NASA API using the following endpoint:

- Endpoint: `[https://api.nasa.gov/your/endpoint](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod)`
- Description: [NASA APOD API Documentation](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod)

## API Documentation

The NASA API provides [documentation](https://api.nasa.gov/documentation) for the various endpoints it supports. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Obtain NASA API Key

1. Generate your NASA API key by visiting [NASA API Key Generator](https://api.nasa.gov/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
